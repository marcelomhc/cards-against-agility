# Cards Against Agility

Cards Against Agility is a quick and fun game to play with your team. Ideal as icebreaker, team building or to open a Retrospective.

You can play in: https://cards-against-agility.web.app/ (Currently in alpha version)

## How to play

To start a game you need a minimum of 3 players (but the more, the merrier!). At the beginning, each player will receive 7 cards with different terms related to Agile Software Development. In each round one black card is randomly selected with a text and a blank spot. One player will be the "host" while all others have to select a card that fills the blank spot in the funniest way possible. The host will select the funniest card and the player that played that card wins one point. The player that has the most points after 7 rounds is considered the winner!

### Development setup

**PRs are very welcome!**

This is my first project using Flutter, I'm using it to learn about the framework (and the Dart language). I appreciate that the code is all over the place, so any help with that is very welcome!

This project was developed using Flutter and Firebase. Most of the files should already be available when you clone the repository but you'll need to setup the Flutter SDK and the Firebase integration. If you need help on that, try following this [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/friendlyeats-flutter#0) first.
